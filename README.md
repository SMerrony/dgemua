A rewrite of my Data General MV/Eclipse emulator in Ada.

The Go version has stalled, I hope this rewrite in Ada will expose some
of the issues in that version.

There are two emulators, a physical one which attempts to mimic classic MV/style hardware, 
and a virtual one which tries to run AOS/VS user programs directly.
