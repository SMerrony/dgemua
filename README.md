A rewrite of my Data General MV/Eclipse emulator in Ada.

Work on the Go version had stalled, this rewrite in Ada has now progressed further in
every aspect than the original version.

There are two emulators, a physical one which attempts to mimic classic MV/style hardware, 
and a virtual one which tries to run AOS/VS user programs directly.  The emulators share
a significant portion of the code.
