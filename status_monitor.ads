-- Status_Monitor maintains a near real-time status screen available on STAT_PORT.
--
-- The screen uses DG DASHER control codes for formatting, so a DASHER terminal emulator
-- should be attached to it for good results.
--
-- The Monitor task waits for status updates
-- from known senders and upon receiving an update refreshes the display of that status
-- on the monitor page.  It is therefore the responsibility of the sender to update the
-- status as often as it sees fit.
