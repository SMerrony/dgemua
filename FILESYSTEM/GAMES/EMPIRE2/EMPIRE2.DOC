                                  EMPIRE
                        THE WARGAME OF THE CENTURY
                            Two Player Version.


	EMPIRE is a simulation of a full-scale war between two emperors,
the you and your opponent.  Naturally, there is only room for one, so
the object of the game is to destroy the other.  Both players play by
the same rules.

	The map is a rectangle 600*1000 miles on a side.  The resolution
is 10, so the map you see is 60*100.  The map consists of sea='.',
land='+', Uncontrolled cities='*', Player 1-controlled cities='O', and
Player 2-controlled cities='X'.  Each emperor gets 1 move per round
(1 round=1 day), moves are done sequentially.

	The map is displayed on the player's screen during movement.
Each piece is represented by a unique character on the map.  With a few
exceptions, you can only have ONE piece on a given location.  On the
map, you are shown only the 8 squares adjacent to your units.  This
information is updated before and after every move.  The map displays
the most recent information known.

STARTING THE GAME:

	Both players MUST have write (and read) access to the directory
:GAMES:EMPIRE2.  When the program starts up it will prompt you for a
file name.  This is the name of the save file for your game in the
above directory.  If the file does not exist, (you are starting a new
game), the program will create it.  Please be considerate and delete
old game files when you are done.  The program will then ask you for
a password.  This is to help keep your half of the game private, because
everyone has read access to your file.  The username and password you
use when you are playing MUST be the same each time.

	The game starts by assigning you one city and your opponent one
city.  Cities can produce new units.  Every city that you own produces
more pieces for you according to the cost of the desired unit.  The
typical play of the game is to issue the Automove command until you
decide to do something special.  During movement in each round, the
player is prompted to move each piece that does not otherwise have an
assigned function.

	Map coordinates are 4-digit numbers.  The first two digits are
the row, the second two digits are the column.

	The pieces are as follows:

Piece	      Player #1 Player #2 Moves	Hits	Cost	Maximum Number
ARMY		  A	   a	   1	 1	 5(6)	500
FIGHTER		  F	   f	   4	 1	10(12)	200
DESTROYER	  D	   d	   2	 3	20(24)	200
SUBMARINE	  S	   s	   2	 2	25(30)	200
TROOP TRANSPORT	  T	   t	   2	 3	30(36)	100
CRUISER		  R	   r	   2	 8	50(60)	100
AIRCRAFT CARRIER  C	   c	   2	 8	60(72)	100
BATTLESHIP	  B	   b	   2	12	75(90)	100
 
 The second column shows the map representation for player 1's units.
 The third shows the representations of player 2's units.
 Moves is the number of squares that unit can move in a single round.
 Hits is the amount of damage a unit can take before it is destroyed.
 Cost is the number of rounds needed to produce another of the same unit.
 The number in parenthesis is the start up cost to produce the unit.
 The last column is the maximum number of that unit that you can have.

1.0  DESCRIPTION OF THE PIECES

Army:		Armies move only on land.  ONLY ARMIES CAN CAPTURE
	CITIES. They have a 50% probability of doing so.  Attacking
	one's own cities results in the army's destruction.   Armies
	can be carried by troop transports.  Just move the army on the
	transport and when the transport moves the army moves with it.
	You cannot attack any ships while on board a transport.  YOU CAN
	NOT MOVE BACK ON A CITY WITH AN ARMY.  This is true EVEN IF YOU
	ARE ON A TROOP TRANSPORT.

Fighter:	Fighters move over sea or land.  They move 4 times per
	round.  They are refueled at controlled cities and carriers.
	They are shot down over uncontrolled cities.  They have a max
	range of 20 spaces.

Ships, general:	All ships can move only on the sea.  They move two times
	per round.  Ships can also dock in a controlled city.  Docked
	ships have damage repaired at rate of 1 hit per round.  If a
	ship is hit badly, it will slow to 1 move per round.

Destroyer:	Typical ship, quickest to produce.

Submarine:	When a submarine scores a hit, 3 hits are exacted
	instead of the usual 1 from the enemy unit.  This is the only
	unit having this property.

Troop Transport: Troop Transports are the only units that can carry
	armies.  They can carry a maximum of 2 * (the number of hits
	left) of armies.  Armies will drown that cannot be carried.

Cruisers:	Typical ship.

Aircraft Carriers: Carriers are the only ships that can carry fighters.
	Carriers carry a maximum of the number of hits left of fighters.

Battleship:	Typical ship.

2.0   FUNCTIONS TO WHICH YOU CAN ASSIGN YOUR PIECES



	Other than just moving your pieces you can assign them the
following automatic functions:

awake:	   cancel current automatic function and return to manual moves.

sentry:	   stay put, do not ask the player to move the piece, wake up
	if an enemy piece comes within sensor range.

direction: move in specified direction, wake up if an enemy piece, enemy
	city, or unoccupied city is encountered.  Temporary wake up if
	an obstacle is in path of movement, after getting a manual move
	from you, THE UNIT IS STILL ASSIGNED A DIRECTION.  A direction
	assignment is represented by the key which sets that direction
	(e.g.:  D means east).

move:	   move towards location assigned to the piece (in editing
	mode).  Wake up if enemy piece is encountered.  Wake up
	temporarily if obstacle is in path of movement.  Represented by
	the coordinate the piece is moving toward.

fill:	   (troop transports and aircraft carriers only) go on sentry
	duty until full of armies or fighters.  Be careful not to
	overfill.  Excess pieces will be drowned next round.

random:	   (for armies only) move at random subject to the following
	conditions:  If an uncontrolled city is adjacent, attack it.  If
	an enemy unit is adjacent, attack it (even if it is a ship).  If
	an unfilled troop transport of yours is adjacent, get on it and
	wake up.  Move if possible without attacking any of your own
	units.  It will not destroy itself unless it is in a city
	surrounded by your units.

	logged on, then prints an appropriate message.

 M:  Move.  Cause a round to be played by you and the computer.

 N:  Redisplays the battle information that is displayed at the
	beginning of your move.

 P:  Re-display current sector on screen.

4.0   MOVEMENT MODE

 
To simply move a piece, type one of the following keys;
 
	QWE
	A D
	ZXC
 
These keys move in the direction of the key from S.  The characters are
not echoed and only 1 character is accepted, so no need for a <Return>.
Hit the SPACE BAR if you want the piece to stay put.
 
Other commands are:
 
H: display Help text (hit any character to continue moving)
 
J: enter Editing Mode
 
G: fill:  put the troop transport (or aircraft carrier) to sleep until
   it accumulates 6 armies (or 8 fighters), then wake it up.  If the
   ship is damaged, the ship will wake up when it has all it can take.
 
I: set unit to moving in a direction specified by the next character
   typed in, i.e. QWE
       	 	  A D
		  ZXC
 
K: wake up piece. If piece is a troop transport or carrier, all armies
   or fighters on board are also woken up.
 
L: set fighter path for city to be the direction following the "L".
 
O: cancel auto move. At the end of the round, Orders Mode will prompt.
   Doesn't affect current piece.
 
P: refresh the screen
 
R: if it's an army, set it to moving at random.
 
S: put on sentry duty.
 
?: display information about the piece. Shows the function, hits left,
   range and number of armies or fighters aboard.

ATTACKING something is accomplished by moving onto the square of the
unit you wish to attack.  Hits are traded off at 50% probability of a
hit landing on one or the other units until one unit is totally
destroyed.  There is only 1 possible winner.

NOTES:

  If you give a piece a direction or move function, they will wake
TEMPORARILY if they run into an obstacle (or enemy).  You must
explicitly wake the piece to regain complete control or assign it
a new function.

  Fighters moving under the command of a function will wake up when they
have  10  rounds of fuel left.  This is to enable you to decide whether
you want to make it kamikaze or send it back to a city for refueling.
Be careful to cancel any currently assigned function before trying to
bring the fighter back.

  You are "allowed" to do FATAL things like, attack your own cities
or other pieces.  If you try to do a fatal move that involves terrain
restrictions, like, drive armys into the sea and ships into land, you
are given a chance to reconsider.  Answer with an "Y" if you want to
commit suicide.  You cannot move onto the edge of the world.

5.0   EDITING MODE

Editing mode allows you to move around the 'world' and check on things.
You can assign and deassign movements and inquire on the production of
cities.  Movements assigned during editing mode do not take effect until
the next round.
 
To move the cursor around, use the standard direction keys.
 
	QWE
	A D
	ZXC
 
Other commands are:
 
H: Display Help text (hit any character to continue editing).
 
O: Exit from editing mode.
 
I: Give piece (or city) the function 'direction', enter the key
	specifying the direction following the 'I'.
 
K: Wake up piece (or cancel city fighter path).
 
M: Put piece (or city) in 'move' function. Type M over piece (or city),
	then move the cursor to where you want it to go, and type 'N'.
	Assigning a 'move' to a city, effects any fighters that land
	there.
 
N: Specify the end point of a move (see M command).
 
P: Display new sector. Each sector represents a 20*70 area of the map, 
	arranged as follows:
		0 5
		1 6
		2 7
		3 8
		4 9
	the sectors overlap by 5 vertically, and 40 horizontally.
 
R: Put army in 'random'.
 
S: Put piece in Sentry mode.
 
Y: Change phase of city that cursor is on top of. When program asks for
	production demands, key in the letter corresponding to what you
	want produced.
 
?: Display information about piece or city. For pieces, displays
	function, range, hits left, any pieces aboard. Cities display
	production, fighter paths, and any pieces in the city.

@:  Displays your current 'holdings'.  ie the number of cities you
	control, the number of each type of piece you own, and the
	number of cities producing each type of piece.

+:  Displays information about all your cities.  This includes what
	the city is producing, when the next one will be done, and 
	how many fighters and ships are docked.

NOTES:

  You can give cities functions.  This doesn't affect the city any, but
any fighter landing in that city will pick up the specified function.
This is useful for setting up automatic fighter movements.

  Note that you cannot affect anything inside a city with the editor.
This also holds for anything on board a troop transport or an aircraft
carrier.
