This is SERPENT, a new version of a previous game called SNAKE.   Its principal
differences from SNAKE are:

    (a)  it runs considerably faster, and
    (b)  it has only one skill level so that competing players listed in
         the log ("SERPENT_SCORERS") are compared at the same level.

The  game is played by using the cursor control keys on the terminal to control
the direction of motion of a snake which runs around on the screen.   The snake
steadily grows longer, so that it becomes increasingly difficult to prevent the
snake from colliding with itself  or with the  walls.   When that happens,  the
game is over.

The  object of  the game is  to accumulate points by running into targets which
appear and disappear at random times and locations.  The targets may or may not
be marked with their point values.  In the latter case a value may be negative,
although the average of many such targets is positive.

Should the screen get blitzed, it can be refreshed by pressing "erase page".
