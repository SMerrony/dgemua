               C B   (A Citizen's Band Radio Simulator) 

CB  will  simulate  the  operation  of  a  40  channel  citizen's  band  radio
receiver/transmitter.  User's of this program can carry on a conversation with
any other user of the CB program by merely typing the message on their console.
All other users who are tuned to the same channel will receive the message.

The CB commands always begin with a '/'.  The CB commands are as follows:

   Command    Action
   /exit      This command will exit from the CB system.
   /stat      This  will  tell you how many people are tuned to what channel,
                  and what channel you are on (the blinking one is your's).
   /ustat     This  will  tell you the channel, PID, and handle of all of the
                  CB users.
   /tune n    By using this you may tune your receiver to channel number 'n'.
   /talk n    This command will allow you to have a private conversation with
                  the user whose PID number  is  'n'.   To  leave  a  private
                  conversation, merely '/tune n' to the desired channel.
   /help      This will be displayed for you.
