     I   SO ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS PLAY BLACKJACK?
     
     MV/Blackjack can perform many tasks other than allow you to play
     blackjack head-to-head against the computer.  But if that's all you
     want to do, execute MV/Blackjack with the macro BJ.CLI and answer the
     questions.  You'll be playing in no time.  
     
     If this is all you want to do, you don't need to read any more
     documentation except for the installation instructions.
               
     
     II  OVERVIEW
     
     There are a few global notes I should make before documenting all the
     detailed parameters that dictate the actions of MV/Blackjack.
     
     First of all, MV/Blackjack is a computer program that simulates the
     casino game of blackjack.  
     
     You must realize that it wasn't written for general distribution.  It
     was written for my own personal use and almost no thought was given to
     make it generalized or easy to use.  
     
     Some terms are mentioned that may not be familiar.  Read How to Play
     Blackjack in the November 1987 FOCUS magazine to familiarize yourself
     with blackjack terms.
     
     MV/Blackjack is a CPU-hog when run in simulation mode when displays are
     suppressed.  If MV/Blackjack is run at a high CLI priority in
     simulation mode with few displays, your system will be CPU-bound.  Your
     best bet will be to lower your CLI priority or do enough displays to
     allow other users some CPU time.  MV/Blackjack offers an input
     parameter where you can adjust your CLI priority.  This is discussed in
     detail later.
               
     
     MV/Blackjack can be run in one of four "modes".
     
     The original purpose of MV/Blackjack was to simulate many hands of
     blackjack so I could experiment with various strategies without losing
     any money in Vegas in the process.  This is called simulation mode.
     Simulation mode simulates not only the dealer but the player as well.
     In this way, if I decided that a certain strategy seemed reasonable,
     I'd 
     
         1   modify MV/Blackjack to perform this strategy, 
         2   run millions of hands, and 
         3   evaluate the results.
     
     Soon after this first mode was written, practice mode was added.  This
     allowed me to play against the simulated dealer.  In this way, I could
     actually play blackjack against the dealer away from the pressures of
     the casino.
     
     A few months before NADGUG Conference '87 in Las Vegas, MV/Blackjack
     was enhanced to include Vegas mode.  This is the "pretty" version of
     MV/Blackjack.  It is in full-color with large white, black, and red
     cards on a felt-green background with white and yellow prompts.  It was
     designed to work on a D470C terminal and it happens to work fairly well
     on other terminal types.
     
     Even though Vegas mode was appropriate for the conference, I created a
     new mode called no-frills mode that is similar to Vegas mode but is
     more practical for practicing.
               
     Another thing to keep in mind about simulation mode: MV/Blackjack has
     never been optimized for speed.  Quite the contrary in fact.  There are
     many redundant checks in MV/Blackjack that are constantly on the
     look-out for anything that might cause the simulation to be
     inconsistent with actual casino play.  My philosophy is, therefore, to
     concentrate on accuracy and pure simulation at the expense of raw
     performance.  On our MV/10000, MV/Blackjack will simulate over 125
     hands per second.  I hope this sufficient for your purposes.
     
     As mentioned, MV/Blackjack was not designed for general use.  If you'd
     like to contact me to discuss MV/Blackjack or blackjack topics, feel
     free to call or write.

     By the way, if you think you've found a bug in MV/Blackjack, you've
     found a feature.  
     
     Just kidding.  I want to know about those too.
               
     III INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
     
     Installing MV/Blackjack is a snap.  Follow these steps:
     
     1   Create a directory for the MV/Blackjack software to reside.  
     2   Dir into it.  
     3   Load the software from tape with a command similar to this: 
         LOAD/V @MTB0:0
     4   MV/Blackjack has now been installed.
     5   Read about the input parameters before running MV/Blackjack.

         AOS/VS
         INFOS II (for Vegas mode)
               
     IV  INPUT PARAMETERS
     
     To start MV/Blackjack:
         1   Be positioned in the directory that contains MV/Blackjack
             software, and
         2   Type "BJ" from the CLI prompt followed by a NEWLINE.
     
     
     Global notes:
     
     o   For all parameters, you can hit NEWLINE to take the default.  Your
         other options are also listed.  The value within the square
         brackets is the default value.  Press NL to accept that value.
     o   There is no way to back up to a previously entered parameter.  The
         only way to change a previously-entered parameter is to ^C^B out of
         MV/Blackjack and start over.
     o   In this documentation, text displayed in bold type is displayed by
         MV/Blackjack.  If you want to import this documentation into CEO,
         the file name is MV_BLACKJACK.DOC.WRD.  If you don't have CEO, a DG
         sales representative will be happy to remedy that situation.
     o   MV/Blackjack assumes you are knowledgable about the input
         parameters.  It is possible to enter conflicting input parameter
         information and receive unpredictable results.  If you intend on
         tampering with the defaults given for parameters, first read the
         documentation carefully.
     o   When a parameter is documented such as "Enter selection: ([x] or
         x):", the "x"s indicate that the parameter values will be
         determined at run-time based on previous selections.  
               
     
     Some parameters that are displayed regardless of mode are:
     
     
     Your CLI priority is listed on the next line.
     2
     Change priority? (NL or Y):
     
     This is your chance to change your CLI priority.  MV/Blackjack is a
     real "CPU hog".  So if you plan on running in simulation mode, you'd
     better lower your priority to something like "3" or better yet, "512".
     Just hit NEWLINE to keep your priority where it is.  
     
     
     Logoff after run? (NL or Y):
     
     Enter a "Y" to have MV/Blackjack log off when he is finished.  
     
     Executing MV/Blackjack...

     My thanks go to those who helped with the development of
     'MV/Blackjack':
     Wayne Akins, Mike Brown, George Sosebee, John Wendel, and Ben Zipperer
     
     Vegas      (Demonstrated at NADGUG Conference '87 in Las Vegas)
     Practice   (1 on 1 with computer with statistics)
     Simulation (Computer simulation with statistics)
     
     Select from above program modes: ([V], P, S):
     
     Enter a "V" for Vegas mode, "P" for practice mode, or "S" for
     simulation mode.
     
     What type of terminal is in use?  (1=Dumb, [2]=D460, 3=D470C):
     
     Answer appropriately.
     
     Are you using a graphics terminal? ([Y] or N, or (~ or |)):
     
     Enter Y if you're using a character graphics terminal.  (A "~" can be
     substituted for "Y".  A "|" can be substituted for "N".  These
     alternative responses are used when MV/Blackjack is executed in /M
     mode.)
               
     Now I'll review the parameters for each mode, starting with the fun
     ones.  
     
     VEGAS MODE -    Vegas mode is what you saw running if you were at
                     NADGUG Conference '87.  You must have a graphics
                     terminal for this mode.  This includes terminals such
                     as D450, D460, D461, or D470C.  This mode was designed
                     to take advantage of the D470C color monitor.  The
                     characters don't display quite right on anything else.
     
     
     Cut out Vegas demo frills? ([Y], or N): 
     
     Enter "N" for pure Vegas mode (like Conference '87).
     
     
     Maximum hands [10]:  
     
     Enter the maximum hands MV/Blackjack will play before automatically
     stopping.
     
     
     Beginning stash [500]:  
     
     Enter the amount of money you want to start playing with.
     
     
     Display banner screen? [Y]:  
     
     Enter "Y" to display the "Welcome to Conference '87" banner.  This will
     only work correctly on a D470C.
     
     Some general verbage and instructions will now be displayed.  You'll be
     given an opportunity to enter your name so that your score will be
     recorded.  If you don't want your score recorded (chicken!) just press
     NEWLINE when prompted for your name.
     
     
     These are all the parameters it takes to start Vegas mode.  When it's
     finished, your score will be recorded and the top scorers will be
     displayed.  The results you see are from the conference.
     
     Note:   The only way to stop Vegas mode is to type the ^C^B sequence.
     Note:   While in Vegas mode, one deck is used with shuffling occurring
             after 55% of the deck has been played.
               
     NO-FRILLS MODE  No-frills mode is my favorite way to play against the
                     computer because it comes the closest to simulating
                     actual casino play.  Practice mode, on the other hand,
                     also allows you to play against the computer.  But it
                     gives you an array of statistics that obviously aren't
                     available while in the casino.
     
     
     First of all, select Vegas mode.
     
     Cut out Vegas demo frills? ([Y], or N): 
     
     Enter "Y" or just press NEWLINE to enter no-frills mode.  
     
     No-frills mode is similar to Vegas mode with the following differences:
     
     1   Maximum hands until automatic termination is 1,000
     2   Your initial stash is $0
     3   The banner screen is never displayed
     4   The discard stack is represented on the 23rd line of the screen
         with the characters "[==========]".  Each "=" symbol represents 10%
         of the cards in the deck.  For example; "[====      ]" would
         indicate that about 40% of the deck has already been played.
     5   Your results are not recorded.  Your results are written to a flat
         file, however, called BJ_NOFRILLS_LOG.  In this way, you can play
         against the computer for many sessions and then check the contents
         of BJ_NOFRILLS_LOG to analyze your performance.  The following is
         an example of the contents of BJ_NOFRILLS_LOG:
     
     30-OCT-87 19:29:22 ASDD.KLM 2FN 45 83.00
     30-OCT-87 19:48:11 ASDD.KLM 2FN 48 10.50
     03-NOV-87 13:03:02 ASDD.KLM 2FN 50 52.50-
     05-NOV-87 17:35:04 ASDD.KLM 2FN 35 27.00
     
         One record is generated each time you play.  The contents of each
         record are:
         1   Run date
         2   Run time
         3   AOS username
         4   Strategy codes for play, bet, and count strategies
         5   Number of hands played
         6   Net stash when finished (stash begins at zero each session)
     
     
     Note:   While in No-frills mode, one deck is used with shuffling
             occurring after 55% of the deck has been played.
               
     SIMULATION MODE     Simulation mode allows you to customize playing
                         conditions and have the computer simulate both
                         dealer and player for a specified number of hands.
                         This is a great way to try out a strategy of your
                         own "the easy way".   Simulation mode is intended
                         for use with D460 terminals.  D470C terminals will
                         not work well.  You can use non-graphics terminals
                         (like D410 and D415) if you answer "N" to the "Use
                         Graphics?" prompt.
     
     
     First of all, select Simulation mode.
     
     Take defaults? ([Y] or N):
     
     Enter N if you want to alter the defaults that have been assigned to
     the input parameters.  If you do not change defaults, the simulation
     begins at this point and no other prompts are given.  If you do change
     defaults, bear in mind that you can not back up from one parameter to a
     previous one.  In order to change a previously-entered parameter, you
     must ^C^B out of the program and begin entering parameters again.
     
     
     The following is a detailed description of each parameter that can be
     user defined at run time.
     
     Iterations between displays [x]:
     
     Enter the number of hands MV/Blackjack should play before the screen
     display is updated.  When you let MV/Blackjack play many hands between
     displays, MV/Blackjack runs much faster.
     
     Batch mode? (Suppresses displays) ([N] or Y]:
     
     Entering Y to this question will suppress ALL screen displays.  This
     feature allows MV/Blackjack to be run in a batch stream.  This option
     hasn't been used for at least a year.
     
     Quick mode? ([Y] or N):
     
     Answering Y here tells MV/Blackjack to only update the graphics portion
     of the screen (the upper half) until the program stops, at which time
     MV/Blackjack will display the final results of the run.  This makes
     MV/Blackjack run faster.
     
     NL after display? ([x] or x):
     
     Entering Y will make MV/Blackjack pause after each screen display and
     wait for you to press NL.  This allows you to examine the results
     before continuing.
               
     Process a maximum no of hands? ([N] or Y):
     
     Enter Y if you want MV/Blackjack to play a maximum number of hands and
     then stop.  It is normal if MV/Blackjack actually plays one more hand
     than you specify.
     
     Maximum hands [1,000]:
     
     If you entered Y to the previous question, you may now enter the number
     of hands MV/Blackjack is to play.
     
     Calculate linear regression? ([Y] or N):
     
     If you enter Y, MV/Blackjack will display (when the maximum number of
     hands have been played) the following:
     
         1   standard error
         2   correlation coefficient
         3   equation for linear regression line
     
     Remember, for this option to work, you must indicate a maximum number
     of hands to be played.
     
     Store graph values? ([N] or Y):
     
     Entering Y here will cause MV/Blackjack to store the X and Y axis
     values to disk each time a bar is drawn on the screen.  The values will
     be in KV_FILE in the subdirectory PR (PR is an abbreviation for
     PRESENT).  The file KV_FILE.DF describes the record layout of the
     file.  This revision of MV/Blackjack allows you to store graph values
     while in batch mode.
     
     Test run number (optional):
     
     This parameter is displayed only if the previous answer was "Y".  Enter
     a number that identifies this run from others.  In this way, you can
     store multiple runs of data in the same file and let PRESENT select the
     run(s) you want to examine.
     
     Y-axis UOM [x]:
     
     Enter the unit of measure the Y-axis should have.  The larger the
     number here, the less the bars will vary in size based on your current
     stash (a "stash" is your net earnings at any point in time).  A value
     of 12 will cause each pixel to represent one betting unit.  This
     parameter really only makes sense when using a D460-type terminal.
               
     Number of decks: ([1], 2, or 4):
     
     Select the number of decks you wish to play with.  Six decks are not
     permitted.  MV/Blackjack is showing his age.  When he was written, a
     6-deck game was the exception.
     
     Play what % of cards before shuffle? [55]:
     
     The dealer shuffles after playing a specified percentage of cards from
     the pack.  Most one- and two-deck games shuffle at about 55%.
     Four-decks are usually shuffled between 65%-75%.
     
     Display shuffle message? ([x] or x):
     
     Indicate if you want to be notified when shuffling is taking place.
     You probably want to enter N when in simulation mode since displaying
     the shuffle message reduces MV/Blackjack's speed.
     
     Play strategy: 1=Stand on value
                    2=Basic strategy
                    3=Braun strategy
                    4=Streak strategy (out of order)
                    5=Wimp (never double or split)
     Play strategy: [2]:
     
     Enter the type of strategy you want to simulate.
     1   Stand on Value will hit when your hand's total is under a specified
         value and stand otherwise.  You can use this option to simulate
         "never bust" and "mimic the dealer" strategies.
     2   Basic Strategy uses the dealer's up-card to determine the optimum
         play.
     3   Braun Strategy uses the dealer's up-card and the true count to
         determine the optimum play (devised by Julian Braun).  This
         strategy should be more profitable than Basic Strategy.  Mr. Braun
         did not fully explain his strategy in his book and will not answer
         my letters.  Therefore, this logic is incomplete and is not a
         reliable simulation of Braun Strategy.
     4   Streak Strategy no longer works.  It proved to be unprofitable so I
         no longer support it with MV/Blackjack.
     5   Wimp strategy will hit or stand using Basic Strategy but will never
         split or double down.
     
     Stand on what value [16]:
     
     This parameter is asked only if you've selected the Stand on Value
     strategy.  Your simulated player will stand when his hand total is less
     than the entered number and hit otherwise.
               
     Count strategy: ([P]oint count, Hi count, or None):
     
     Enter the strategy used to count cards.  Point count is the strategy
     discussed in the FOCUS article.  Hi Count did not prove to be
     profitable and is no longer supported.
     
     Bet strategy: (True count, [K]im, Ian, Streak, or Flat):
     
     True count will vary the bet based on the true count.  Kim count is the
     betting strategy I'm currently working on for personal use.  It is
     based on the true count and streaks of previous winning and losing
     hands.  This strategy is still evolving.  Ian strategy attempts to bet
     like a tourist while actually betting based on the true count (See Ian
     Andersen's book listed in additional reading section).  Do not choose
     the Streak option.  The Flat option will make every bet equal.
     
     First betting unit is 1
     Raise to 2nd bet at what count [3] (999 for 0):
     
     Enter the true count that you want your bet increased.  If you want it
     increased at true count of "0", enter 999.
     
     2nd betting factor: [10]:
     
     Enter the factor to increase your bet by at the above-indicated count.
     
     The above two prompts will be repeated several more times depending on
     the bet strategy chosen.  This will allow you to place various bets at
     various true count values.
     
     One betting unit [1]:
     
     Enter the amount of your betting unit.  I suggest you always enter 1,
     then multiply your results by the betting unit you'll actually play
     with in Vegas.
     
     Approximate remaining decks (Half, Full, [N]o):
     
     This parameter determines how accurate MV/Blackjack will be when
     approximating the number of remaining decks there are.  You can have
     MV/Blackjack approximate to the nearest half deck, full deck, or use no
     approximation at all.  I suggest using no approximation.
     
     Take insurance? ([N] or Y):
     
     Indicate whether MV/Blackjack should take insurance or not.
     
     Minimum true knt for insurance bet: [3] (99.9 for 0):
     
     Enter the minimum true count at which you'll take insurance.  This
     parameter isn't asked if you answered N to the previous question.
               
     Maximum true knt for insurance bet: [999.99] (99.9 for 0)
     
     Enter the maximum true count at which you'll take insurance.  This
     parameter isn't asked if you requested no insurance.
     
     Display insurance bets only? ([N] or Y):
     
     Entering Y will cause MV/Blackjack to only display those hands which
     involve insurance.
     
     Display big bets only? ([N] or Y):
     
     Entering Y will cause MV/Blackjack to only display those hands whose
     bets are greater than the true count specified in the next parameter.
     
     True knt for big bet: [3]:
     
     Enter the true count that determines a "big bet".
     
     Maximum stash desired [9,999,999.99]:
     
     MV/Blackjack will stop if the stash becomes greater than this number.
     
     Minimum stash desired [-9,999,999.99]:
     
     MV/Blackjack will stop if the stash becomes less than this number.
     
     Count initial pair percentages? ([N] or Y):
     
     This option was used while debugging MV/Blackjack.
     
     John's or Bill's generator? ([J] or B):
     
     Always use John's random number generator.
     
     How many times to shuffle deck? (even #) [4]:
     
     The shuffling algorithm used by MV/Blackjack simulates the shuffling
     rituals used in Las Vegas.  The deck will be separated and "riffled"
     back into one stack (it is an arithmetic condition that requires this
     parameter be an even number).
     
     Enter seed number? ([N] or Y):
     
     This random number generator needs a seed number to start.  You may
     either enter it yourself or the program will produce one.  The
     advantage of entering it yourself is that you can run multiple
     simulations that will all shuffle the cards in exactly the same
     pattern.
               
     Enter seed number:
     
     Enter a 7 digit number.  This parameter is entered only if the previous
     question was answered Y.
     
     Bell after display? ([N] or Y):
     
     Answer Y if the bell should sound when MV/Blackjack updates the
     screen.  This would be appropriate if you were displaying progress
     after a great many hands and you want to be notified when the screen
     has been displayed.
     
     Print the screen when done? ([N] or Y):
     
     Used with direct connect printer of the D460.  This option hasn't been
     tested since 1984.
     
     Check Popik streaks? ([N] or Y):
     
     Mr. Popik wrote a book outlining a strategy which I proved didn't
     work.  This option hasn't been tested since 1986.
     
     How many hands in a Popik streak? [5]:
     
     Related to above parameter.  It's not worth your time.
     
     Desk checking? ([N] or Y):
     
     Used in debugging MV/Blackjack.
     
     Recording session? ([N] or Y):
     
     Answering Y will write a record to SESSION_FILE.  Look at
     SESSION_FILE.DF in the subdirectory PR for a record description.  With
     this option, you can run MV/Blackjack many times and record the results
     of each session.  Then use PRESENT to evaluate the contents of
     SESSION_FILE.
     
     Print patterns report? ([N] or Y):
     
     This parameter will print a 132 column character graph showing the
     relationship between winning and losing hands and the current stash.
     One record is printed to the file each time the screen statistics are
     updated.  The left axis shows the current stash in betting units.  The
     line drawn with "*" characters show winning and losing streaks.  That
     is, the "*" is printed one character higher than the last record if the
     current hand was a winner.  The "*" is printed one line lower if the
     hand lost.  The "$" character indicates the current stash.
               
     Pause before starting? ([N] or Y):
     
     Enter Y if you want MV/Blackjack to pause before starting the
     simulation.
     
     Number of seconds to pause (1 hour = 3600):
     
     If you want to pause, indicate how long.
               
     PRACTICE MODE   Practice mode uses the same screen layout as simulation
                     mode does.  The same basic input parameters are used.
                     If you don't have a graphics terminal, this is the only
                     mode you can use to practice.  Practice mode is
                     intended for use with D460 terminals.  D470C terminals
                     will not work well.  You can use non-graphics terminals
                     (like D410 and D415) if you answer "N" to the "Use
                     Graphics?" prompt.
     
                     Note:   To exit practice mode, press the BREAK ESC key
                             when asked for your bet.
     
     
     First of all, select Practice mode.
     
     Notify of incorrect plays? ([Y] or N):
     
     Enter Y if you want MV/Blackjack to let you know when you make a play
     that doesn't follow basic strategy.
     
     Notify of incorrect bets? ([N] or Y):
     
     Entering Y will tell MV/Blackjack to notify you when you don't bet
     according to some crazy betting scheme I thought of about a year ago.
     I suggest you always take the default here.
     
     Take defaults? ([Y] or N):
     
     Enter N if you want to alter the defaults that have been assigned to
     the remaining input parameters.  If you do not change defaults, the
     simulation begins at this point and no other prompts are given.  If you
     do change defaults, bear in mind that you can not back up from one
     parameter to a previous one.  In order to change a previously-entered
     parameter, you must ^C^B out of the program and begin entering
     parameters again.
     
     Since the parameters are similar to Simulation Mode, they will not be
     discussed again here.
               
     V   SCREEN ITEM DEFINITIONS
     
     The meanings of the items that appear on the screen for simulation and
     practice mode may not be obvious to you.  I will now describe the
     contents of the screen.  It would be best if you would be looking at
     the screen layout while you read this.
     
     Instead of explaining fields one line at a time, I'll take them in
     logical groups.
     
     The top 11 lines are used to draw a step-bar graph as MV/Blackjack
     simulates blackjack.  (If you don't have a graphics terminal, you'll
     have to specify such in the input parameters and these lines will be
     blank.)  The x-axis represents the number of hands played.  The y-axis
     represents your current stash.  The unit of measure for the y-axis is
     indicated at the beginning of line 12.  A bar is drawn each time
     MV/Blackjack updates the screen.  MV/Blackjack updates the screen based
     on the Iterations between displays parameter.  For example, if you
     requested 14 iterations between displays, then there will be one bar
     drawn after each 14 hands are played.  In this example, you'll see a
     maximum of 77x14=1078 hands on one screen.
     
     The first 15 or so characters of lines 13-16 display static information
     that was set when entering parameters.  Line 13 tells you how many
     decks are being used and at what percentage the deck will be shuffled.
     This line also tells you what the current betting unit is.  Line 14
     indicates what play strategy and card counting strategy is in use.
     These values correspond to the values entered in parameter entry.  Line
     15 shows you what betting strategy is in use.  Line 16 shows you the
     seed number used in the random number generator.  This line also shows
     whether the decks will be approximated when determining the number of
     remaining decks.
     
     Now look just to the right of the lines just described (lines 13-16).
     If you're using a graphics terminal, you'll see a symbol that
     represents the dealer's discard tray.  As cards are played, you'll
     notice the tray will fill up.  This simulates the image you see when
     you're playing in the casino and you calculate the number of decks
     remaining by looking at the discard stack.
     
     The cards that are in play are displayed just to the right of the
     dealer's discard stack.  The dealer's hand is displayed on line 12
     starting about column 23.  The dealer's up-card shows up as "()" when
     not using a graphics terminal.  Your hand is shown on line 14.  If you
     split a hand it's shown on line 15.  These card and suit characters are
     displayed with graphics characters or ascii characters, depending on
     whether you selected graphics mode or not.
               
     Now look on line 14 at about column 60.  This is where a summary of the
     previous hand is displayed.  The first number is the amount of the last
     bet.  The number just to the right of that shows the amount you won
     from that hand.  The literal to the right of that (far right side of
     line 14) indicates who won the last hand.
     
     Look to the far left of lines 12 and 13.  Line 12 shows the percent of
     hands the dealer has won over the player.  Remember, even when you play
     perfectly, the dealer will win more hands than you.  You compensate by
     winning the profitable hands (blackjacks and double downs).  The right
     side of line 13 shows the "flat bet dealer's edge".  It shows what the
     dealer's advantage would be if every bet placed would have been the
     same.  It is common when playing a winning strategy to see the dealer's
     "flat bet" edge be positive while we're winning money.  This is because
     we bet larger when the deck is favorable for us.  Remember, both of
     these percentages are displayed in the dealer's advantage.  A positive
     number indicates the dealer's advantage, a negative number indicates
     our advantage.  These numbers usually are positive, even when we're
     winning.
     
     On to line 17.  It is a line of column headings for the data below it.
     Let's take this data in its logical groupings.
     
     On line 18, under the "Win% Lose% Psh%" column heading, you'll find the
     percent of hands that you have won, lost, and pushed (tied).  At the
     left side of row 19 shows the profit (or loss if negative) you are
     currently winning per 100 hands.
     
     Look now at line 21.  Here you see your net earnings this session.
     Just to the right of that is the total number of hands played this
     session.  Just to the right of that is the total number of decks played
     this session (this number is in parentheses).  Now look at line 22.
     Here you see the minimum stash you've had this session followed by the
     number of the hand it occurred.  Line 23 shows your maximum stash this
     session and what hand it occurred on.
     
     Now look at line 18 under the "Dbl Down" column heading.  Here you'll
     find more column headings labeled "%Tot" and "%W/L".  On the line under
     "%Tot" is the percent of total hands played that have been double
     downs.  Under that is the total number of hands that have been double
     downs.  On the line under "%W/L" is the percent of double downs that
     have been won.  Under that is the percent of double downs that have
     been lost.  Any other double downs not represented in these two numbers
     were pushed.
     
     Under the "Split Pairs" heading you'll find information with the same
     organization as for "Dbl Down" explained above.
               
     The "Insurance" heading highlights data pertaining to hands that
     involved insurance.  On the line under "%Tot" is the percent of total
     hands played that you have taken insurance.  Under the "%Won" heading
     is the percent of insurance hands that you've won.  Underneath these
     figures on line 20 you'll find an amount representing the total
     winnings per 100 hands of insurance and the total amount won from all
     insurance hands played thus far.
     
     Now I'll explain the lower-right block of information with the heading
     "Knt Factr %Tot PerH".  These fields relate to bets that have been
     varied based on the true count.  For example, the first line under the
     column heading indicates that when the true count is less than the
     indicated value (under "Knt") and the betting factor is as indicated
     under "Factr", the percentage of hands played under these circumstances
     is indicated under "%Tot" and the amount won or lost per 100 hands is
     displayed under "PerH".  The next line shows the same information when
     the count is between the count indicated and less than the next line
     shown.  This pattern continues until the last line in this block, when
     the data shown is applicable when the count is greater than the count
     shown.
     
     The only other data displayed on this screen is found near the bottom
     of the screen towards the middle on lines 22 and 23.  This is where
     some statistical amounts are displayed.  These amounts only appear at
     the end of the run when you're playing a stated number of hands
     (indicated with the Process a maximum no of hands? input parameter).
     In the middle of line 23 you'll find the linear regression equation for
     this run.  The equation will be in y=A+Bx format.  Above the equation
     you'll find the text "S=" which denotes the value for the standard
     error.  To the right of that value you'll find "r=" which is the
     correlation coefficient.
