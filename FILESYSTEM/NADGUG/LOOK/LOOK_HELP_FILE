*COMMAND_LINE
LOOK{/WINDOW_LIMIT=<integer>}  <file_name>

The LOOK command line is currently simple.  The CLI macro that
invokes the LOOK program provides for LOOKing at a series of files
sequentially, and for specifying a file list by template.  The
LOOK program itself interprets a single argument, and, currently,
one switch, the WINDOW_LIMIT switch.

The single argument is interpreted as a file to LOOK at.

The WINDOW_LIMIT switch specifies how many lines the CRT display you
are using has.  The value of the switch is taken to be the number
of lines LOOK can expect to use for windows after subtracting its
overhead of three lines.  So, for a "standard" terminal, 21 is a
good value, and 21 is in fact the default value of this switch.
*KEYS

^f1  position to first line. (same as "TOP")
^f2  position to the last line. (same as "BOTTOM")
^f3  position to the approximate middle of the file. (same as "MIDDLE")
^f4  redisplay current page. (same as "CURRENT")
*NEWS
LOOK <file_list>

LOOK may be used to browse through files.

Features in look 2.03:
  1 ^C^A interupt handled.
  2 DEFINE, WINDOW, and VIEW commands, to manipulate multiple files.
  3 COLUMN command, to display lines longer than 79 characters.
  4 WINDOW_LIMIT switch on invocation, to describe screen size.
Features in LOOK 3.00:
  1 Several bugs fixed.
  2 WRITE command to output selected lines from the current view.
  3 Format of beginning of file, end of file, and page break
    displays changed.
*SEARCH_STRING
<SEARCH_STRING>

	The "find" and "backfind" command both accept search strings.
	A search string may specify an "exact match" or a "template".

	An "exact match" is specified by enclosing the search string
	in double quotes. For example, "Dod" would not match "dod".

	A template is specified by an argument containing no blanks,
	or enclosed in single quotes.
	All template matching is case-insensitive. 
	A single space in the template string matches one or more
	spaces and tabs. The template character "+" matches any
	sequence of characters (up to end-of-line).

	For example, the template 'ret+to sender' could match:
	   1)  "return   to   sender"
	   2)  "RETURN quickly to   sender"
*SUMMARY
LOOK<optional_switches>   <file_list>

LOOK may be used to browse through files.
Type "HELP <topic>" for more information on a specific topic.
Type "HELP *NEWS" for a description of recent changes.

APPROXIMATE
APPROXIMATE <number>
	Display a page of the file located at the
	approximate distance within the file given by the
	<number> argument. The <number> argument is interpreted
	as a decimal fraction where the decimal point is immediately
	to the left of the first digit.

	For example, "APPROXIMATE 33" displays the page in
	the file which is about one third of the way (0.33)
	into the file.  "APPROXIMATE 033" on the other hand,
	displays the line beginning at slightly over 3/100 of the
        way into the file.

	<number> may be in the range 0001 to 9999. 
	Leading zeroes are significant.

	You may enter a <number> instead of a command.
	This is a shorthand for "approximate <number>".    
BACKFIND
BACKFIND <search_string> 

	Performs a "backwards" search for <search_string>.
	The search terminates at the beginning of the file.

	If no <search_string> is given, the <search_string>
	last specified on either a "find" or "backfind"
	command will be used.

	Type "HELP *SEARCH_STRING" for details on the syntax
	and semantics of <search_string>.

	The line which matches the <search_string> will be 
	displayed at the top of the view window.

BOTTOM
BOTTOM

	Display the last page of the file.
BYE
BYE

	Exits from "LOOK".

CLI
CLI

	Escape from look into the CLI
COLUMN
COLUMN <optional column number>

	This command sets the display column for all windows
	to its argument if present, and to 1 if not.

	This means that lines will be displayed starting in
	the column you specify until you re-specify the column.
CURRENT
CURRENT

	Re-displays the current "page".

DEFINE
DEFINE <viewnum> <pathname> <opt_windowstart> <opt_windowend>

    The DEFINE command defines a window for the display of text from
    a file.  The view number and pathname are required, but the
    window start and window end will default to 1 and 21, respectively.
    Lines for windows are numbered 1-21, starting with the line just
    below the command line.

    See also "VIEW" and "WINDOW".
DOWN
DOWN <opt_lines>

	Moves the display towards the end of the file.

	The default if no argument is given is to move
	1/2 the width of the current view's window.


FIND
FIND <search_string> 

	Performs a "forward" search for <search_string>.
	The search terminates at the end of the file.

	If no <search_string> is given, the <search_string>
	last specified on either a "find" or "backfind"
	command will be used.

	type "HELP *SEARCH_STRING" for details on the syntax
	and semantics of <search_string>.

	The line which matches the <search_string> will be 
	displayed at the top of the view window.

FLIP
FLIP <marker_number>

	Display the page "marked" by <marker_number>.

	There are five markers.

	Markers 1 and 2 may be specified with function keys.
	Type "HELP *KEYS" for more information.
HELP
HELP <help_topic>

	Display information on "look" topics or commands.

	<help_topic> may be either a command name or a topic
	name. Topiic names begin with "*". The <help_topic>
	need only be specified to the minimum number of
	characters to make the name unique. 

	If no arguments are given, then a "help *summary" is
	performed. This summary gives the list of commands
	and topics.
MARK
MARK <marker_number>

	Leave a book mark specified by <marker_number> at the
	current page. 

	There are five markers.

	You may use the "flip" command to display a page
	at a marker.

	You may set markers 1 and 2 with function keys.
	type "help *keys" for more information.
MIDDLE
MIDDLE

	Display the page located approximately midway into the
	file. 
NEXT
NEXT  <number>

	Advance <number> pages and display the page at that location.

	The next page is displayed with an overlap of one line
	from the previous page.
PREVIOUS
PREVIOUS <number>

	Back up <number> pages and display the page at new position.

	The previous page is displayed with an overlap of one line
	from the current page.
TOP
TOP

	Position to the top (first line) of the file.

UP
UP <opt_lines>

	Moves the display towards the beginning of the file.

	The default if no argument is given is to move
	1/2 the width of the current view's window.
VIEW
VIEW <viewnum>

    The VIEW command is used to switch the LOOK processor's
    "attention" to a specific file-to-screen-window connection,
    called a "view".  There are currently 4 views, numbered 1 to 4,
    and the function keys 5 to 8 are defined to switch views
    conveniently.

    See also "DEFINE" and "WINDOW".
WINDOW
WINDOW <opt_windowstart> <opt_windowend>

    The WINDOW command is used to re-define the bounds of the current
    view's screen window.  If no arguments are given, the window is
    set to the enitre screen, as if you had used "WINDOW 1 21".

    See also "DEFINE" and "VIEW"
WRITE
WRITE <filename> <opt_number_of_lines>

    Append text to the file <filename> from the current position
    for <opt_number_of_lines> lines.  The default for number of
    lines is the current screen length.

    Note that this writes text much as it appears in the screen
    window, not as it really is in the file.
