Search

   The search function allows you to search for a file by using all or part of
   the filename. After hitting the search key, you will be asked for a 'string'
   of characters for which to search. After typing your characters, hit <NL>
   to begin the search. Search forward <F2> will start at the current file and
   look forward for the string. Search backward Shift <F2> will start at the
   current file and look backward for the string. If the string is found, the
   filename is which the string is found becomes the current file. Otherwise,
   the current file remains the same.
