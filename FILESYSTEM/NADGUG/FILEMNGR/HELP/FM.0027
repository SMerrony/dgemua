was written on an MV/8000 and (presumably) can be used only on AOS/VS. If you
like this program and it is useful to you, send me $30.00 or whatever you think
this program is worth. If you have suggestions, comments, enhancement ideas,
questions, or ridicule, please feel free to drop me a line or give me a call.
