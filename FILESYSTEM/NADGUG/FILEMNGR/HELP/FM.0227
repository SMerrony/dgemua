Change Directory

   When FILEMNGR is first executed, the working directory is the directory
   displayed on the screen (the current directory). The current directory can
   be changed in one of two ways. Pressing Shift <F3> will allow you to change
   the current directory. At the bottom of the screen, you will be asked for
   the name of the new directory. The current directory can also be changed by
   moving the cursor to the filename of a subdirectory or the parent directory
   (bolded for easy location) and pressing the newline key. After confirmation,
   the current directory will be changed to that directory.
