Mark Files

   Files can be marked so an operation can be performed on more than one file
   at a time. <F6> will mark the current file and advance the current file
   pointer to the next file. An asterisk (*) just to the left of the
   filename indicates a file is marked. Shift <F6> or space will
   unmark the current file. Operations capable of being performed on marked
   files are copy, move, delete, and printing a list. See help on these
   operations for details.
