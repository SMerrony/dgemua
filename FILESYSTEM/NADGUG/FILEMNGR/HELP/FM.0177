Shell

   FILEMNGR was written specifically to interface with Word Perfect
   Corporation's office automation system WP Library (which is an excellent
   system). FILEMNGR will interface with the shell menu in two ways. Pressing
   Ctrl <F1> will take you directly to the shell menu (provided the program
   was called through the shell). Pressing the home key and a letter will take
   you directly to the program corresponding to the letter in the shell menu.
   If you are not interfacing with WP Library, Ctrl <F1> will execute a CLI
   process.  To exit CLI and return to FILEMNGR, just type bye.
