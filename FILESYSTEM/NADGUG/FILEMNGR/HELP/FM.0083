Sort File

   When FILEMNGR is executed, the filenames are displayed in alphabetical
   order by name. This order can be changed. The list of files can be sorted by
   name, date created, date last accessed, date last modified, in decending
   order by size. Pressing S will prompt the user for the method to sort
   the files. If one of the dates is used for sorting, it will then become the
   date displayed in the file information section. This date can be changed by
   pressing Shift <F5>. Under the directory information is a message
   telling how the file list is currently sorted.
