Date Display

   There are three dates associated with each file: the date of creation, the
   date last accessed, and the date last modified. FILEMNGR only shows one of
   these dates on the screen at a time. The date is displayed in the file
   information section. The date can be changed by pressing Ctrl <F5>. This
   will rotate the dates.
