Execute CLI with initial IPC

   Pressing X will prompt the user for a string to be used as the initial
   IPC message for CLI. When the string is entered, CLI will be executed with
   the string as the initial IPC. The percent sign (%) is used as a place
   holder for the name of the current file. The percent sign will be expanded
   to the name of the current file before execution of CLI. Thus, the initial
   IPC message 'X %' would execute the current file.
